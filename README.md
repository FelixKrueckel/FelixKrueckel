👋 Hi, my name is Felix Krueckel and I live near Aachen, Germany since my bday in 2004.  
👀 I’m interested in computers, engineering, design, sports, business and people.  
🌱 I’m currently studying frontend (html, css & js) and microservice (node, docker, sql) development.  
💞️ I'd love to collaborate on projects that add a lot of value, no matter what tech stack.
