👋 Hi, my name is @FelixKrueckel and I live near Aachen, Germany since my bday in 2004.<br>
👀 I’m interested in computers, engineering, design, sports, business and people.<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning about PWAs, Node JS and Databases like MySQL.<br>
💞️ I'd love to collaborate on projects that add a lot of value, no matter what tech stack.<br>
